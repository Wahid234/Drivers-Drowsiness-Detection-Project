# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

A real-time driver drowsiness detection system using eye state analysis. Captures driver images via mobile camera and uses machine learning to detect signs of drowsiness.

## Project Overview
This system consists of two main components:
1. **Mobile Application**: Captures driver images (2 images/minute) and communicates with API
2. **Detection Model**: Uses Haar cascade classifier for face detection and pre-trained CNN for eye state classification

Workflow:
1. Mobile app captures and sends images to API
2. Server processes images using OpenCV and ML model
3. Returns eye state classification with confidence score
4. Triggers alerts when eyes are closed beyond threshold
